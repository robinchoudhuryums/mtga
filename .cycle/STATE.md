## Session — systems map + agreement gate (2026-07-29)

The task-first systems map landed (`docs/systems-map.md`), the agreement gate landed
(`scripts/check_agreement.py`, the twelfth hard gate), and the map's top finding was
fixed: `_weakest_cut` and `rank_cut_candidates` both answered "this deck's most-cuttable
card" and **disagreed on 36 of 64 decks**. Both now score through one `cut_keep_score`.
Subcommand count held flat at 33 — a duplicate model was removed, not added.
Block: `.cycle/blocks/2026-07-systems-map-agreement-gate.md`.

Also: `load_rarities` was the one reference-table loader never memoized, and it was
**85% of `deck.py cuts`' runtime**. Found by profiling the new gate, not by reading.

## Where I left off (previous session)
Feedback segmentation is implemented, mutation-tested, gated and committed on
`claude/add-cards-ingested-batch-cy2tdb`. Nothing is half-done. Block:
`.cycle/blocks/2026-07-feedback-segmentation-broad-implement.md`. Docs for it are
NOT yet written — see DOCUMENTATION UPDATES NEEDED in that block; run /sync-docs.

Earlier in the cycle: the three card-misread findings, and the 42a / 46 / 20
ingests (PR #85, merged). Prior block:
`.cycle/blocks/2026-07-card-misread-causes-broad-implement.md`.

## Completed this session
- Finding 1 — `cuts` multiplier co-signal (`✱`) + a `lifegain` doubler axis.
  Root cause was a CALLER, not a model: `doubler_axis`/`doubler_support` already
  scored Delney correctly for `suggest-homes`; `cuts` never asked.
- Finding 2 — `deck.py screen <id> <names…>`, re-scoring a candidate pile against
  the deck as it currently stands. Wired into /draft-deck and /tune-deck.
- Finding 3 — `strict_upgrades`, surfaced by `screen` as `★ STRICT UPGRADE`.
- Deck 46 (Radiant Ascension) was built and refined across this session and is at
  tier A, floor A, 60 cards, 16 craft targets.

## Decisions made
- The multiplier term only ever RAISES a keep-score. The no-support case is already
  handled by theme-fit; subtracting would punish the same card twice.
- `strict_upgrades` is text-containment with colour identity deliberately EXCLUDED,
  so a containment result never depends on the deck's colours. Conservative by
  design; its silence is explicitly not a verdict.
- The lifegain axis requires the literal "twice that much" — a plus-N replacement
  (Angel of Vitality) is templated identically and must not qualify.
- Anchor 16's WIRING half lives in tests/test_deck_models.py, since a pure-function
  anchor structurally cannot see whether a caller invokes the function.

## Session — creature cut-ranking hypothesis (2026-07-29, later)

Tested the standing P/T hypothesis and **rejected it**. Pre-registered, one evaluation,
scored on git-reconstructed pre-swap snapshots across all 31 creature cuts. A bounded
±3 body term changed nothing (predicted: `fit` median 44 vs a ±3 term); scaled to the fit
IQR it made agreement slightly worse; and cut creatures are indistinguishable from kept
creatures on body quality (17/31, p=0.72). Nothing shipped from the hypothesis.

What did ship: `segment_concentration` + a per-deck breakdown in `deck.py feedback`,
because the test found the creature rate running 0%–100% per deck — the 45% is largely a
statement about which decks were edited. Block:
`.cycle/blocks/2026-07-creature-cut-hypothesis-test.md`.

## Session — CLAUDE.md split (2026-07-29, later still)

**CLAUDE.md 2,219 → 956 lines, nothing deleted.** Each operative rule (plus any live
residual) stays in the auto-loaded file with an anchor; the incident, measurement and
reasoning moved VERBATIM to `docs/gotchas.md`. Gated by `scripts/check_docs.py`
(anchor round-trip both ways, vendored section names, per-bullet line cap).
Conservation proved 69/69 byte-identical and mutation-tested. Cycle Workflow Config
deliberately deferred to a follow-up pass, agreed with the user.
Block: `.cycle/blocks/2026-07-claude-md-split.md`.

## Open follow-ons
See FOLLOW-ON ITEMS in each block. Highest value now:
1. **Compress Cycle Workflow Config** (336 lines) — the agreed phase 2 of the doc
   split. The `- Testing:` subsystem entry is a single 11,600-character bullet and the
   `Test Command:` paragraph is 2,260 words; both are reference, not operative. Riskier
   than phase 1 because the vendored workflow commands consume that section
   structurally — but `check_docs` already asserts its field labels, so the safety net
   exists.
2. **`_signature_themes` saturates in `cuts`** — the +2 keep-boost fires on 86% of
   nonland cards across the 22 `#: protect:` decks (100% in decks 20 and 46), because
   `cuts` reads the LOOSE signature set while all three `fit_strength` callers read the
   STRICT one. Switching would unify them and de-saturate to 66%; the motivating case
   (deck 30's counter-doublers) survives. Needs a roster-wide before/after diff first.
   Measured in `docs/systems-map.md` §7.
3. `tier --audit-rationale` false negative — a `_HISTORY_CUES` cue about one card
   suppresses a citation of ANOTHER card in the same window, even when that
   clause says the card STAYS. Deck 42a asserted "Erode stay[s]" after Erode was
   cut and the audit reported clean. Fix is the mirror of `_cites_as_arriving`;
   needs a roster sweep before landing.
4. An incremental `make refresh` — still ~10 min for a 4-card ingest, the largest
   single cost in the repo. Must not fork the rebuild order into a second recipe.
5. The reverse `screen` flag (a candidate strictly WORSE than an incumbent).

## Decided AGAINST (2026-07-29, the split)
- Reorganising CLAUDE.md by topic. The vendored workflow commands name its sections
  verbatim and cannot be edited here, so a rename breaks a command with no local fix.
- Deduping the gotchas against README (26 of 57 are about a subcommand README already
  documents). That needs a second judgement per rule and a wrong call loses information
  silently; one destination, one judgement.
- Rewriting the evidence while moving it. Verbatim movement is what makes the
  conservation check an exact-equality proof instead of a fuzzy overlap.

## Decided AGAINST (2026-07-29, later)
- Shipping any body-quality term in the cut ranking. It failed its pre-registered test;
  a term that fails and ships anyway is worse than no term.
- Tuning the concentration report's share threshold until deck 46 appeared. The first
  draft used >20% and deck 46 sits at 19.4%; the threshold was REMOVED rather than
  lowered, because a cutoff tuned until the expected finding shows up is that finding
  smuggled into a constant.
- Recording BUILD-vs-TUNE context at `swap --apply`. It would separate the populations
  properly, but it needs every skill to pass it — another hand-kept thing that rots — and
  the split has not survived a large enough sample to earn that.

## Decided AGAINST (2026-07-29)
- Vendoring the Tier-3 `systems-map` command. It produces a MODULE map, and the module
  structure was never the friction — the map that was needed is task-first and
  hand-written. CLAUDE.md's Command-provenance paragraph now records this.
- Fixing the `_signature_themes` saturation in the same session it was measured. It
  changes the cut ranking, and the standing rule is that a scoring change needs a
  roster-wide diff first. Recorded with numbers instead of landed blind.
- Moving `check_suggest` #13 and the `test_verify_ingest` rebuild-order check into the
  new agreement gate. That would trade one registry for two.

## Decided AGAINST (previous session)
- Re-weighting `cuts` to normalize its fit sum. Simulated across all 64 decks:
  top-3 themes moves correlation(tag count, keep-rank) +0.73 -> +0.72 and changes
  1% of top-5 shortlist slots; mean-of-hits reaches +0.60 and over-rewards narrow
  cards. The effect is not double-counting within a card — tag count proxies for
  "described by the tag vocabulary at all". Reporting the split is the fix.
- Promoting decks 41 or 42a to tier A. Both sit one band below an A floor by a
  written, still-true argument; the guard permits that and does not nag.
