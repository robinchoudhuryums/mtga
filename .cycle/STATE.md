# Cycle state — 2026-07

## Where I left off
Feedback segmentation is implemented, mutation-tested, gated and committed on
`claude/add-cards-ingested-batch-cy2tdb`. Nothing is half-done. Block:
`.cycle/blocks/2026-07-feedback-segmentation-broad-implement.md`. Docs for it are
NOT yet written — see DOCUMENTATION UPDATES NEEDED in that block; run /sync-docs.

Earlier in the cycle: the three card-misread findings, and the 42a / 46 / 20
ingests (PR #85, merged). Prior block:
`.cycle/blocks/2026-07-card-misread-causes-broad-implement.md`.

## Completed this session
- Finding 1 — `cuts` multiplier co-signal (`✱`) + a `lifegain` doubler axis.
  Root cause was a CALLER, not a model: `doubler_axis`/`doubler_support` already
  scored Delney correctly for `suggest-homes`; `cuts` never asked.
- Finding 2 — `deck.py screen <id> <names…>`, re-scoring a candidate pile against
  the deck as it currently stands. Wired into /draft-deck and /tune-deck.
- Finding 3 — `strict_upgrades`, surfaced by `screen` as `★ STRICT UPGRADE`.
- Deck 46 (Radiant Ascension) was built and refined across this session and is at
  tier A, floor A, 60 cards, 16 craft targets.

## Decisions made
- The multiplier term only ever RAISES a keep-score. The no-support case is already
  handled by theme-fit; subtracting would punish the same card twice.
- `strict_upgrades` is text-containment with colour identity deliberately EXCLUDED,
  so a containment result never depends on the deck's colours. Conservative by
  design; its silence is explicitly not a verdict.
- The lifegain axis requires the literal "twice that much" — a plus-N replacement
  (Angel of Vitality) is templated identically and must not qualify.
- Anchor 16's WIRING half lives in tests/test_deck_models.py, since a pure-function
  anchor structurally cannot see whether a caller invokes the function.

## Open follow-ons
See FOLLOW-ON ITEMS in each block. Highest value now:
1. `tier --audit-rationale` false negative — a `_HISTORY_CUES` cue about one card
   suppresses a citation of ANOTHER card in the same window, even when that
   clause says the card STAYS. Deck 42a asserted "Erode stay[s]" after Erode was
   cut and the audit reported clean. Fix is the mirror of `_cites_as_arriving`;
   needs a roster sweep before landing.
2. /sync-docs for the segmented feedback report and the `cuts` tag-count property.
3. The reverse `screen` flag (a candidate strictly WORSE than an incumbent).

## Decided AGAINST this session
- Re-weighting `cuts` to normalize its fit sum. Simulated across all 64 decks:
  top-3 themes moves correlation(tag count, keep-rank) +0.73 -> +0.72 and changes
  1% of top-5 shortlist slots; mean-of-hits reaches +0.60 and over-rewards narrow
  cards. The effect is not double-counting within a card — tag count proxies for
  "described by the tag vocabulary at all". Reporting the split is the fix.
- Promoting decks 41 or 42a to tier A. Both sit one band below an A floor by a
  written, still-true argument; the guard permits that and does not nag.
